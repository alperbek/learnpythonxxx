# Roadmap for Python

## 1. Learn Syntax and Basics

Firstly start with the installation of Python in your system. Just visit on Python’s official site, download the latest version and you are good to go.

Once the installation has completed, you may use IDLE to write and run Python code. Now we are going to list out some topics to start with learning Python.

_It will take almost 1 – 1.5 weeks to cover all the basic stuff._

- The Python shell, basic arithmetic.
- Control structures.
- Accepting user input, Strings & Typecasting.
- Looping in Python: For & While loops.
- Exception handling.
- Functions, modules & Imports.

## 2. OOPs Concepts, Built-in Data Structures, and Other Stuff

This section will be a bit tough especially if you don’t know about object-oriented programming concepts. Take the help of some resources which we have mentioned and with some practice, you will be able to understand the concepts.

These concepts will be widely used in making complex applications so understand these topics very well.

_It may take 1 – 1.5 weeks to learn_.

- Object oriented programming in Python
- Lists & List functions
- Regular Expressions
- List comprehension
- List slicing
- String formatting
- Lambdas
- List, Dictionaries & Tuples

## 3. Frameworks for Web Development

There are so many frameworks for web applications in Python some of them are Django, Flask, Bottle, Tornado, and Pyramid.

### Django:

A high level web framework mostly used in startups and enterprise for web development. It follows the MVC pattern and you can use multiple databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

If you are a complete beginner and not aware of the terminology authentication, URL routing, API and models then you will feel a lot of pain while learning Django but take your time, have patience, go through some more resources and understand each line of code. Slowly and gradually you will understand everything.

_Learning Django may take 2 – 2.5 weeks._

### Flask:

Flask is one of the easiest microframework to learn in Python. If you wish to develop a simple and lightweight web application then Flask is suitable for that. It is not as powerful and extensive as Django still provides features such as support for unit testing and building REST APIs.

_Learning Flask will take 1 – 1.5 weeks._

## 4. For Building Desktop Applications

Tkinter, PyQT, Kivy, WxPython or PyGUI libraries are very good for building desktop-based applications.

### Tkinter:

Tkinter is open source library and it allows you to build desktop GUI applications using Python. Learning Tkinter is simple and provides a graphical interface. It will take around 1 week to learn Tkinter.

### PyQT:

PyQt is one of the most powerful cross-platform GUI library owned by Nokia. It combines Python programming and the Qt library. It can be used to design graphical user interfaces for a desktop application.

### Kivy:

It can be used to create desktop applications also it supports platforms like Android, iOS, Linux & Raspberry Pi.

## 5. For Data Analysis

Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Bokeh, SciPy, Matplotlib these libraries are good for data analysis. These libraries are helpful for those who want to become data analysts/ data scientists. Learning Numpy or Pandas will take around 1 week.

### Numpy:

It is an array-processing package and provides high-performance array object. It is widely used for scientific computing with Python and provides essential features.

### Pandas:

Pandas is also a very good open-source library that is used for data analysis. It provides high-level data structures (such as DataFrame) and a vast variety of tools for analysis. It also can translate complex operations in a few commands. Using this library, data manipulation becomes a much easier task.

## 6. For Machine Learning:

### TensorFlow:

Most popular deep learning library developed by Google. It is a computational framework used to express algorithms that involve numerous Tensor operations.

### Scikit-Learn:

A machine learning library for Python, designed to work with numerical libraries such as SciPy & NumPy.

### PyTorch:

It can handle dynamic computation graphs on the go. It also provides easy to use API.
